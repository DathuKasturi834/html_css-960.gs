                        Nature is defined as our environment. It is the interaction between the physical world around us and the life within
                         it like the atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna and humans. Nature also includes non-living 
                         things such as water, mountains, landscape, plants, trees and many other things.

                        The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities,
                         innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the 
                         Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals,
                          and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, ever since.
